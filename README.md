# XeEngine

An open source app/game engine. It is not production ready, but it is definitively possible to create full commercial games.

The engine is on version 0.x, which means that the API compatibility could break easily between minor versions.

## Compatibility
The following systems are supported:

* Windows 7 or greater
* Universal Windows Platform (UWP, for Microsoft Store)*
* Microsoft Xbox One*
* Sony Playstation Vita*


\*A developer license proof is needed to have access on the platform.

## Installation

1) Add the environment path XESDK_DIR specifying the folder of the cloned SDK.

2) Be sure to compile under Visual Studio 2017, using Windows SDK 10.0.17134.0

## Create an application

If you copy templates/visualstudio into Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\Project Templates then you will be able to create pre-configured projects from scratch.

It is possible to view some samples too to learn how to use XeSDK:
